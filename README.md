# Project Mojave
## Introduction
This is an ongoing passion project, a small strategy game based on RISK with a few changes. It's set on a single board and (will) support both local bot-play and multiplayer. Each playable colour is indicitive of a faction within the series, though there is no gameplay differences between them. Roleplay between players is encouraged.

The board itself is based on the design by AMCAImaron on DeviantArt

## Technical
The project is made in Unity version 2021.3.45f2 as it is my preferred LTS release before the changes to the input system. I am using PUN2 for the networking.

## Personal Note
This christmas break, I had some spare time so I built a homemade RISK board based on the Fallout series. Me and a few of my (nerdier) friends all love RISK, the sessions were great even if they did get a little larpy. It was a lot of fun and it seems a shame to let the sessions end now that we've moved back out for University, so I started this as an effort to digitise the board; so we can still play the odd game despite the distance.

My physical board, currently hanging on my wall: 

I love strategy games and I've always wanted to make a digital verison of RISK, I've attempted a few times and never felt I had the technical know-how to complete it. After completing my previous project Colonial, and doing some research into how games such a CK3 work; I've felt pretty inspired to give it another shot. This is just a casual passion project, I don't have any big plans for releases or a schedule or anything so just bare with me.
